    <h1>Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles</h1>
    <span>
        <p>Ford developed the Ford GT-40 and it failed catastrophically during testing. The 40 stood for it's only 40 inch height. Ford executives reached out
        to master mechanic and racecar driver Carroll Shelby for help. Shelby agreed under one condition, his own
        race driver, Ken Miles would race the car. They both improved the car and made it quicker.</p>

        <p>Eventually, the Ford team left for the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, Ken Miles was left behind. Ford
        executives didn't like Ken Miles. All GT-40s entered into the race failed, and Ford was left with an embarrassing loss.
        </p>
    
        <p>Shelby wanted to prove that Miles was a great race car driver. He stated that if Miles lost the 24 Hours of Daytona,
        he would sell his company, Shelby American to Ford. Ford agreed, and they attempted to sabatoge Miles. However, Shelby noticed,
        and pushed Miles to win the 24 Hours of Daytona. He was now on Ford's Le Mans team.
