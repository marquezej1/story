    <h1>Ford... Buying Ferrari?</h1>
    <p> In 1963, Ford saw that Ferrari, known for winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans, was struggling to stay alive.
    Ford decided to buyout Ferrari. In exchange for saving the company, Ford would gain control over Ferrari's 
    road car division and partial control over Scuderia Ferrari, the racing team.</p>

    <p>Enzo Ferrari, the founder of the company, was disgusted at the thought of Ford controlling his race team.
    Enzo insulted the Ford representatives and told them to go back to their "little factories to build ugly cars" and denied the offer.
    Enzo then sold half of Ferrari to Fiat, a competitor to Ford at the time.</p> 
    <p> Henry Ford II was enraged, and told them to build a car to beat Ferrari no matter the cost.</p>
