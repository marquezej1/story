        Enzo Ferrari, seeing Ford's failures last year, wasn't worried about the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. 
        However, Enzo's calmness did not last as Ford had overtaken Ferrari with Ken Miles leading. Ford saw that
        the three GT40s entered were in positions 1, 2, and 3, and told Miles to slow down to have a photo finish.

        Miles reluctantly agreed, and slowed down. Sadly, this cost him the lead, and Ford driver Bruce McLaren took the victory.
        Enzo Ferrari congratulated Miles for the win.
